# Vaccine Trial Database Development
In this project we collected business rules from documents, forms, policies and procedures, and interviews and using those business rules to create a Crow's Foot ERD of an organization's data needs on Microsoft Visio.
##Overview
A doctor has come to you to develop a database to help track the results of a vaccine trial. You will
receive information from the doctor that will include an organizational document, some policies and
procedures for the testing, and you will be able to speak with the doctor himself to answer any
questions. The doctor doesnâ€™t want anything super complex. He just wants to be able to track the
patients in the trial, the clinicians involved with the trial, and the results of the trial at each visit.
##Your Assignment
Based on the business rules that you discover from the information given, create an ERD for the
database the doctor requires. Create the ERD using crows foot notation and submit it to canvas in a PDF
format.
