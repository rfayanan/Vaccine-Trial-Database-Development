# Project Overview
A doctor has come to you to develop a database to help track the results of a vaccine trial. You will
receive information from the doctor that will include an organizational document, some policies and
procedures for the testing, and you will be able to speak with the doctor himself to answer any
questions. The doctor doesnâ€™t want anything super complex. He just wants to be able to track the
patients in the trial, the clinicians involved with the trial, and the results of the trial at each visit.

In the first half of the project I collected business rules from documents, forms, policies and procedures and interviews and then using these business rules I created a Crow's Foot ERD of the organization's data needs on Microsoft Visio. In the second part of the project, I implemented the ERD in IBM Db2 by making tablespaces for each table, indices for all primary and foreign keys and placing some dummy data into each of the tables.
